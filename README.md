## What it does

On fast paced jobs requiring file re-naming and a mix of card/tethered shooting, it's easy to accidentally lose track of the filename counter across various directories and end up with counter collisions — duplicate trailing numbers spanning multiple folders (e.g. `shot02_flatlay_2261.raf` and `shot12_stadium_2261.raf`). This tool surfaces those conflicts instantly.

- Scans all subfolders recursively
- Detects duplicate trailing frame numbers across any RAW format
- Groups consecutive duplicate runs by directory pairing to keep the report readable
- Lets you exclude specific directories before running the check (test shots, pre-light, etc.)
- Trash folders are always excluded automatically
- Cross-format collisions are flagged intentionally — a `1002.NEF` and a `1002.CR2` in different folders will still surface as a collision, since shared frame numbers can cause conflicts regardless of format
